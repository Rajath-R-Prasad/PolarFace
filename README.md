# PolarFace: Facial Recognition App

This repository contains the source code for the PolarFace application, a facial recognition system.

The project is divided into two main components:

*   **Backend:** A Python-based server that handles facial recognition logic, database management, and API services.
*   **Frontend:** A React Native mobile application that provides the user interface for interacting with the system.
